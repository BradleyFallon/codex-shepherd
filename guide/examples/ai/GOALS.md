# Project Goals

These goals are authoritative and immutable.

The project is considered complete when:

- All requirements defined in authoritative design documents are implemented.
- All documented constraints are enforced with no violations.
- There are no unresolved ambiguities in authoritative sources.
- All automated tasks complete without retries exceeding limits.

Non-goals:
- No new features beyond those defined in authoritative sources.
- No refactors or optimizations unless explicitly required by authoritative sources.
- No behavior inferred from optional or contextual documents.

If any goal cannot be evaluated deterministically, execution must stop.
